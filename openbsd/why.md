# Why OpenBSD?

OpenBSD is a minimalist operating system: my full web development
setup takes 4GB on disk, and rarely eats more than 4GB of memory.

OpenBSD has everything I need in base: X11, cwm, xterm, tmux, vi,
httpd, etc. All those programs are well documented, have consistent
APIs, and sane defaults. There is almost nothing to configure.

You can install OpenBSD on [bare metal](/openbsd/hardware.html) in
ten minutes with all 3rd-party packages and personal data restored
from the latest backup.

You should [try it out](/openbsd/).
