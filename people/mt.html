<p><b>Marat Tukhvatullin</b><br>
<em>Software Developer</em><br>

<hr>

<p class="f4 f3-m f3-l lh-title ni">&#8220;Marat and I started working
together at Cinarra Systems in 2012, where within a small team of early
employees we built the first version of the product: an advertising
platform bridging the worlds of mobile operators and brands.</p>

<p>At that time, I was building frontends and Marat was responsible for
design and development of our backend (RESTful API, Java, and
PostgreSQL). Marat is a amazing software engineer always focused on
clarity and simplicity. Even in crazy times&mdash;not unusual for a
typical startup&mdash;Marat was patient and advocated for a simple
design and doing things right.</p>

<p>It is a pleasure to work with Marat, he is a master of his craft and
makes things done. I would highly recommend him for any opportunity
requiring knowledge of design and development of high-performant
systems.</p>

Feel free to email me if you have any questions.&#8221;</p>
