<p id="mk" class="f4 f3-m f3-l lh-title ni">&#8220;Two days ago I thought
that everything I would write about is already written, and probably
not once. Now I feel kind of tickle going to write something (in

find spare couple hours yet :)&#8221;</p>

I appreciate your work - ssg, your how-to's for less familiar users,
etc. I felt I should mention that to you &#x1F600;&#8221;</p>
